    Generate spatial null maps via eigenstrapping [1]_. hopefully this renders: [[1]_]. what about
    this: :func:`nulls.eigenstrap`.
    
    This function generates spatial null maps that preserve the spatial autocorrelation structure of
    brain maps through random rotation of geometric eigenmodes. The method works by rotating
    eigenmodes within eigengroups (sets of modes with similar eigenvalues), then reconstructing null
    maps using the original decomposition coefficients.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like
        Empirical brain map(s) of shape (n_verts,) or (n_verts, n_maps) to generate nulls from. If
        n_maps > 1, the same set of randomized rotations is applied to all maps for each null (see
        Notes). 
    emodes : array-like of shape (n_verts, n_modes)
        The eigenmodes array of shape (n_verts, n_modes). This function rotates modes within
        eigengroups. Note that, unlike the original implementation as shown in [1]_, this requires
        the constant mode (the first column) to be input too. If the number of eigenmodes is not a
        perfect square (i.e., number of modes doesn't allow for complete eigengroups), then the last
        incomplete eigengroup will be excluded.
    evals : array-like of shape (n_modes,)
        The eigenvalues array of shape (n_modes,). Note that, unlike the original implementation as
        shown in [1]_, this requires the zero eigenvalue (the first eigenvalue) to be input too. 
    n_nulls : int, optional
        Number of null maps to generate per input map. Default is 1000.
    n_groups : int or None, optional
        Number of eigengroups to use for generating nulls. If `None`, uses all complete eigengroups
        contained in `emodes` (⌊√(n_modes)⌋). Default is `None`.
    rotation_method : str, optional
        The method used to generate random rotations for each eigengroup. Either `'qr'` to generate
        random orthogonal matrices using QR decomposition of random normal matrices, or `'scipy'` to
        sample random orthogonal matrices from SO(N) using `scipy.stats.special_ortho_group.rvs`.
        Default is `'qr'`. See Notes for details on which option to choose.
    randomize : bool, optional
        Whether to shuffle decomposition coefficients within eigengroups. This increases
        randomization but reduces spatial autocorrelation similarity to empirical data. Default is
        `False`.
    residual : str, optional
        How to handle reconstruction residuals after generating null maps. Either `None` to exclude
        residuals, `'add'` to add original residuals, or `'permute'` to adds shuffled residuals.
        Default is `None`. See Notes for details on which option to choose.
    resample : bool, optional
        How to resample values from original data. Options are `'exact'` to match the sorted
        distribution of the original data, `'affine'` to match the original mean and standard
        deviation, `'mean'` to match the mean, and `'range'` to match the minimum and maximum.
        Default is `None` for no resampling.
    decomp_method : str, optional
        The method used for eigendecomposition, either `'project'` to project data into a
        mass-orthonormal space or `'regress'` for least-squares fitting. Default is `'project'`.
    mass : array-like, optional
        The mass matrix of shape (n_verts, n_verts) used for the decomposition when `decomp_method`
        is `'project'`. Default is `None`.
    seed : array-like of shape (n_nulls,) or int, optional
        Random seed for reproducibility. If an array of shape (n_nulls,) is provided, it is used
        directly as the seed for each null. Otherwise, if a single integer is provided, it is used
        to generate a master seed that is then used to generate a different seed for each null. If
        `None`, the global state is used. Default is `None`.
    check_ortho : bool, optional
        Whether to check if `emodes` are mass-orthonormal before using the `'project'` method in
        `neuromodes.basis.decompose`. Default is `True`.
    
    Returns
    -------
    ndarray of shape (n_verts, n_nulls) or (n_verts, n_nulls, n_maps)
        Generated null maps of shape (n_verts, n_nulls) if data has shape (n_verts,), or (n_verts,
        n_nulls, n_maps) if data has shape (n_verts, n_maps).
    
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `emodes` is not a 2D array or has n_verts ≥ n_modes.
    ValueError
        If `evals` length doesn't match number of columns in `emodes`.
    ValueError
        If `residual` is not one of `None`, `'add'`, or `'permute'`.
    ValueError
        If `resample` is not one of `None`, `'exact'`, `'affine'`, `'mean'`, or `'range'`.
    ValueError
        If `rotation_method` is not one of `'qr'` or `'scipy'`.
    ValueError
        If `n_groups` is greater than the number of eigengroups than can be formed from the number
        of modes in `emodes`.

    Notes
    -----
    1. Same transformations for each map. When ``data`` contains multiple maps (``n_maps > 1``),
       the same set of randomized rotations is applied to all maps for each null. This means that
       null i for map A and null i for map B use identical eigenmode rotations.

    2. ``n_groups`` and ``residual``. The choice of ``n_groups`` and ``residual`` will affect the
       spatial autocorrelation similarity between the nulls and empirical data. See [1]_ for a
       heuristic for choosing ``n_groups`` and to see how the choice of ``residual`` affects the
       spatial autocorrelation of the nulls.

    3. ``rotation_method``. ``rotation_method='scipy'`` is largely a legacy option to match the
       original implementation of eigenstrapping, which uses this method. The scipy method is
       recommended only for users who want to exactly match the original implementation of
       eigenstrapping. ``rotation_method='qr'`` is generally faster, especially for larger numbers
       of modes and nulls, and is recommended for most users. See more similarities/differences in
       the notes below.

    4. ``resample``. The choice of ``resample`` will affect the distribution of values in the
       nulls. ``'mean'``, ``'affine'``, and ``'range'`` are linear transformations, while
       ``'exact'`` is a non-linear transformation. ``'mean'`` preserves the location (mean) of the
       distribution, while ``'affine'`` preserves the location and scale (mean and standard
       deviation) of the distribution. As these are both affine transformations, they preserve the
       "relative PSD" of the distribution. In contrast, ``'range'`` and ``'exact'`` do not preserve
       the relative PSD of the distribution, as they change the location and scale of the
       reconstructed nulls. The choice of ``resample`` should be guided by the importance of
       matching the original distribution of values and ultimately by whichever option produces the
       lowest false discovery rate (FDR). See [1]_ for an example of how to compute the FDR.

    5. ``seed``. Seeding is handled differently depending on the input type.

       a. If ``seed`` is an integer and ``n_nulls > 1``, then it is used to initialize a master
          random number generator (RNG) for each null map (this will start at a random integer
          given by ``seed`` and will then increment). Then, each null uses its allocated integer
          to generate its own RNG to use for all rotations/permutations of that null. If
          ``n_nulls`` is 1, then the seed is used directly to initialize the RNG for that null.

       b. If ``seed`` is an array of integers, then it is used directly to seed the RNG for each
          null.

       c. If ``seed`` is ``None``, the global state is used to generate rotations (this will match
          the original implementation [1]_).

    6. Comparisons with original implementation. The following notes are in relation to the
       original implementation of eigenstrapping in [1]_, which is available
       `here <https://github.com/SNG-Newy/eigenstrapping>`_.
       Here, we have made a few changes to the implementation. These changes simplify installation,
       increase speed, process multiple maps concurrently, and facilitate reproducibility.
       Nonetheless, under a specific configuration, the function can exactly match the default
       usage of the implementation (i.e. generating the same nulls when the corresponding seed is
       set). See
       `here <https://neuromodes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation/eigenstrapping_match_orig.html>`_
       for an example.

       a. Simplified installation. ``eigenstrapping`` is dependent on many packages, including
          exact versions of ``brainspace`` and ``lapy``. In contrast, ``neuromodes`` depends on
          much fewer packages. This makes installation easier and reduces the risk of conflicts
          with other packages.

       b. Speed comparison. When generating 1000 nulls for one map on a 4k surface using 100
          modes, the methods take:

          i.   ``SurfaceEigenstrapping(n=1000)``:        3.80 seconds
          ii.  ``eigenstrap(rotation_method='scipy')``:  1.12 seconds (exactly the same output as i)
          iii. ``eigenstrap(rotation_method='qr')``:     0.10 seconds

          See
          `here <https://neuromodes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation/eigenstrapping_compare_speeds.html>`_
          for more comparisons between the ``'scipy'`` and ``'qr'`` methods.

       c. Lack of ``cholmod``. The original implementation uses ``cholmod`` for fast sparse matrix
          operations when computing the original calculation of geometric eigenmodes. In contrast,
          in order to simplify installation, this implementation does not use ``cholmod``. This has
          some impacts on how quickly modes can be computed. However, as they can be computed once
          and then saved, we hope that this will not be a major issue for users (we welcome
          contributions to add support for this!).

       d. Lack of parallelization from ``joblib``. The original implementation uses ``joblib`` to
          parallelize the generation of nulls across multiple CPU cores. Given our generation of
          nulls is faster, we have not implemented that at this stage. We welcome contributions to
          add support for this, but note that it may be difficult to implement this in a way that
          is reproducible across different numbers of nulls/maps/cores/seeding strategies. We note
          that the original implementation is not reproducible when using ``joblib`` due to the
          order in which the seeds are generated/used.

       e. Only match default. We are able to exactly match the default functionality of the
          original implementation, but not all possible configurations. This is because of some
          changes we have made to increase speed and facilitate reproducibility. In particular,
          when ``randomize=False`` and ``residual=None``, the output of
          ``eigenstrap(rotation_method='scipy')`` will match the original output (see below for
          more parameters which also need to be specified). However, if ``randomize=True`` or
          ``residual='permute'``, it is not possible to match results between the two
          implementations. This is because of changes we have made to increase speed.

       f. Changes to RNG. Here, we have changed to ``numpy``'s newer ``Generator`` for random
          number generation, which means that the global seed does not affect the output of the
          function when using ``rotation_method='qr'``. This is in contrast to the original
          implementation, which used the legacy ``RandomState`` approach. See the last paragraph
          in the 'Quick Start' section
          `here <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html#random-quick-start>`_
          for more information about the change. In particular, the original implementation was
          affected by the global seed when using ``seed=None``; this is preserved in
          ``rotation_method='scipy'`` for compatibility, but not in ``rotation_method='qr'``.

       g. Use of first mode. This function uses the constant mode (first column of ``emodes``) and
          its corresponding eigenvalue to generate mean-preserving nulls. In contrast, the original
          implementation excludes the constant mode and its eigenvalue. Whereas in the original
          implementation users were expected to input ``emodes`` and ``evals`` with the constant
          mode/eigenvalue removed (something of the form ``emodes[:, 1:]`` and ``evals[1:]``),
          here users are expected to input ``emodes`` and ``evals`` with the constant
          mode/eigenvalue included.

       h. Concurrent processing of multiple maps. This function can process multiple maps at the
          same time. This was possible in the original implementation, but required users to save
          rotation matrices and reapply them to all maps.

       i. Resample AND add residuals. If both resampling and adding residuals is requested, the
          original implementation adds residuals after resampling. Here, the order of these steps
          is swapped (i.e., add residuals and then resample). This ensures that the resampling
          remains intact (e.g., that the surrogates and original actually have the same values).
          If (instead) the resampling is done before the residuals are added, then neither step
          will remain intact. This difference is only relevant if both ``resample`` and
          ``residual`` are used.

       j. Syntax for exact replication. To exactly match the default version of the original
          implementation of eigenstrapping in [1]_, users must do the following:

          - Ensure ``data`` has a mean of zero.
          - Set the global seed before running this function (e.g., ``np.random.seed(seed)``).
          - Set ``resample='range'``
          - Set ``decomp_method='regress'``
          - Set ``rotation_method='scipy'``

          Note that the original implementation (``eigenstrapping.SurfaceEigenstrapping``) must
          also be run with a particular configuration to ensure reproducibility/compatibility:

          - Set the global seed before running ``SurfaceEigenstrapping(...)`` (e.g.,
            ``np.random.seed(seed)``).
          - Additionally, pass this seed into the function call:
            ``SurfaceEigenstrapping(..., seed=seed)``
          - Remember to remove the first eigenmode/eigenvalue from the call to
            ``SurfaceEigenstrapping``

          For an example of how to do this, see
          `this notebook <https://neuromodes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation/eigenstrapping_match_orig.html>`_.

    """
    Rotate coefficients using `scipy.stats.special_ortho_group.rvs` to sample random orthogonal
    matrices from SO(N). This is largely a legacy option to match the original implementation of
    eigenstrapping, which uses this method. The QR method is generally faster, especially for larger
    numbers of modes and nulls, and is recommended for most users. The scipy method is recommended
    only for users who want to exactly match the original implementation of eigenstrapping.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inv_coeffs : array of shape (n_modes, n_nulls, n_maps)
        The inverse-transformed coefficients (spheroid -> ellipsoid) of shape (n_modes, n_nulls,
        n_maps) to rotate.
    groups : list of arrays
        A list of arrays, where each array contains the indices of modes belonging to the same
        eigengroup.
    seeds : array of shape (n_nulls,)
        An array of integer seeds of shape (n_nulls,) to use for reproducibility of the random
        rotations for each null map.
